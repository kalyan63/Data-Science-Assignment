# Answers to Assignment 1 questions
1. Answer for question 1 to 3 is given in a pdf file
2. *Answer for Question 4:* 
    > Results of the algorithm is:

        > For K=2:  cost=2.04
        > For K=4:  Cost=1.71
        > For K=10: Cost=1.59

    > To run this algorithm: 

        Required libraries are: pandas, numpy
        Run "kcenter.py" file to find the 2-approx K center.
        Run optkcenter.py to find optimal k center.
        
        Warning:
            For finding optimal center it takes 10^12 time for just finding 2 centers
            Need a super computer to solve this.
3. **Answer for Question 5:**

    >The main problem was to choose two features which has Intresting relation between them.
    >There were some missing data which I had to fill using sklearn SimpleImputer.
    >Next task was to select important countries for studying.
    >Then Interpret from the video which was made from plotting the data of selected countries.  

    >To Generate graphs for above video run :

        "code for Q5.py"

    >We can view all the plots in Q5 plots file.
